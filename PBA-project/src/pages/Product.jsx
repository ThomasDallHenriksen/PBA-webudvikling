                    <p> The Airplate is a small, self-contained solution to tagging and tracking
                        your drones and arial devices, consisting of a single unit with a volume
                        of less than 51 cm3 and weighs less than 58 grams(battery included). It
                        can be retrofitted onto existing drones or inplemented during
                        production. It can be charged through USB-C and has 2+ hrs of battery
                        operation from a single full charge. It can also be integrated without
                        battery, directly powered from the drone with 5 V.
